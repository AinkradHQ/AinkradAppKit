/// into per-distinct-block work.

/// own, which matters because a long session's transcript is unbounded. The
/// count limit is a second bound for the ordinary case.

/// The cache key is the source string alone. Safe because callers apply font
/// and colour to the resulting `Text`, not to the `AttributedString` — if that
/// ever changes, this key must grow to include the styling.
