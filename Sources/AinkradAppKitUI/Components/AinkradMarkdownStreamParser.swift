///
/// **Why this exists.** The transcript re-parsed the WHOLE message on every SSE
/// delta, so rendering an n-token reply cost Θ(n²). This parses each block once.
///
/// **How it is correct.** `AinkradMarkdownBlocks.parse` is a single-pass line scan whose
/// only cross-line state is "inside a fence". A blank line outside a fence always
/// flushes the paragraph, produces no block, and ends any list run — so for a
/// split at such a line, `parse(head + tail) == parse(head) + parse(tail)`.
/// That line is the COMMIT POINT: everything before it is parsed once into
/// `committed` and never revisited; only `pending` (at most one block's worth of
/// text) is re-parsed as deltas arrive.
///
/// `AinkradMarkdownBlocks.parse` remains the single source of truth for what markdown
/// means. This type only decides *how little of it* to re-run, and
/// `AinkradMarkdownStreamParserTests` asserts equivalence at every prefix, including a
/// 300-document fuzz sweep.
